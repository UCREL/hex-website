title: Terms for Undergraduate Students
---

In addition to the terms of use set out for each service on Hex, undergraduate student access is granted under the following terms:

1) Students *must* be supervised by someone in the NLP or Cyber Security groups
2) The supervisor is primarily responsible for all software support first before passing queries over to a sysadmin
3) Questions to sysadmins will be relayed to Prof. Paul Rayson and the respective supervisor
5) Third Year Projects are limited to the lower 4 nodes
6) Capacity is determined on a first-come first-serve basis and is shared with other TYP students.
7) Backups are currently not available so **users are responsible for their own data retention**.

If you would like access to Hex for your project, please start by contacting your supervisor to have them request access on your behalf.
