This is a slowly growing list of other (externally run) courses on how to operate HPC resources. These are not affiliated with Hex, and any Hex-queries should be directed back to us here.


## DiRAC HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING FACILITY

The Folks at the DiRAC organisation have a number of really well written courses covering various aspects of scientific computing. Naturally these are intended to train folks to use their own resources at DiRAC, but many of them are completely transferrable to Hex and HEC. The [Training Pages](https://dirac.ac.uk/training/) include courses on Slurm, MPI and OpenMP (as of Dec 2024) and many others available too.

The following courses have been examined in particular to align well with Hex:

- [Foundation HPC-Skills](https://dirac.ac.uk/courses/hpc-skills-training/)
    - BASH and Command Line Skills
    - Version control with Git
    - Software Engineering Principles
    - Testing, Documenting and Reviewing Code
    - Principles of Code Scaling

We expect this list to grow as we review more of the excellent available courses. If you have explored the DiRAC resources, please do let us know how well they fit with our compute resources, so we can maintain this list!
