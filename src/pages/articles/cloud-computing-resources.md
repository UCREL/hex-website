## Google Cloud

PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and nonprofit researchers are eligible for a research grant.   
After a proposal is submitted you can receive up to $5,000 in free Google cloud credits. 
To submit a proposal you will need to complete this [form](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/research/?modal_active=none). 
Fields include:
* Some personal information
* Details about you institution and field of research
* Details about the project proposal 
You will then need to use the provided pricing calculator to indicate the anticipated costs. You will also need to provide a Google Cloud billing account ID.
The credits expire after one year and you will need to fill out a question in the form about how you plan to continue funding the project after this.

Currently struggling to get more information about this offering. To go so I need to complete the get started form which appears to be uninteractabe?

Full time researchers, faculty members and students (graduate, post-graduate an PhD) are eligible
Reviewing your application is likely to take 90 to 120 days (though elsewhere is says 30 to 60 days). 
Awards for students are capped at $5000 with faculty and staff awards not capped. 
Credits awarded expire after 1 year.
The application form requirements are similar to Google Cloud's as stated above.
