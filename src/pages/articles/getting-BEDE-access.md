(add details to step 1)
## Step 1: Contact the Lancaster Uni Research Software Engineer for BEDE
Sam Bland 

## Step 2: Find emails related to SAFE website login:
You should receive an email with the subject "Welcome to SAFE" from SAFE Administration 
It will include links to allow you to setup your login for the SAFE website. This website will allow you to manage a project and get a machine account for BEDE

## Step 3: Create a password with the link then complete this registration form
