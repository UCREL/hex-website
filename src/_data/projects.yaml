  year: 2024
  description:
    - The IAA-Oracle-ULTEC Project leverages advanced text processing tools to conduct in-depth linguistic analysis.
    - The project efficiently manages and analyses large datasets using the TextProcessor class, which enables the precise extraction of linguistic features and the identification of geographically named entities through NLP models.
    - Hosted on Hex, this setup ensures optimal performance and scalability, making it ideal for handling the extensive computational demands of text analysis tasks, especially those involving cleaned texts post-OCR processing, significantly reducing the time and effort needed to analyse such vast datasets.

  description:
    - With the Lancaster Uni SCC-UCREL Hex (in about 13hours), we processed 1000 Holocaust survivors' testimonies to extract spatial entities - toponyms (towns/cities, countries, continents), geographic feature nouns (ghettos, hills, and camps), events and times as well as sentiments  and emotions.
